		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p></p>New Brunswick Tamil Association (NBTA) is a non-profit association for the Tamil-speaking community and beyond. NBTA primarily focuses on serving the Tamil-speaking community in New Brunswick, it is also open to individuals and organizations from other backgrounds who are interested in learning about Tamil culture and traditions, or who wish to participate in the events and activities organized by the association. Our aim is to promote language, traditions, culture, and togetherness among diasporans settling in New Brunswick, who call the province home.</main>
